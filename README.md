# Objective

This web application scans food labels and surfaces in real time any matches against a user-defined list of allergens.

# Demo

# Areas for improvement

1. Camera doesn't focus very well for small fonts. This is apparently due to the lack of proper support across all devices and browsers.
2. Highlighting the allergen directly on the camera video so that the user's attention can be immediately drawn to the detected allergen.
3. Automatically match against scientific names so that this burden of knowledge is offloaded from the user - e.g. `Arachis Oil` is the scientific name for peanut oil, `Mandelonas` refers to peanuts soaked in almond flavouring
